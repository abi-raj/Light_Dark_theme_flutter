# Flutter Light & Dark Theme.
A simple application made with [Provider](https://pub.dev/packages/provider) and [Shared Preferences](https://pub.dev/packages/shared_preferences), where you can **change the theme** and gets applied throughout the app and also persisting the Theme, so that the application **remembers your choice** while opening next time.
